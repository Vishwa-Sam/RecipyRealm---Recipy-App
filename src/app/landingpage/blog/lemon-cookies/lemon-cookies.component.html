    <h2>🌿 Why No-Bake Cookies Are a Healthier Treat</h2>
    <div class="content-block">

      <p class="content-text">
        No-bake cookies skip the heavy butter and refined flour often used in baked desserts.
        They’re packed with oats for fiber, nut butter for protein, and honey for natural sweetness.
        Plus, skipping the oven means more nutrients stay intact — and you save energy too!
        Oats provide slow-releasing carbs that keep you full for longer, while lemon adds a
        refreshing dose of vitamin C to boost your immune system. By relying on natural
        ingredients and minimal processing, these cookies let you enjoy indulgence in a much
        lighter way. Think of them as a balance between dessert and energy snack — great for
        workouts, hikes, or late-night cravings when you want something sweet but wholesome.

        <div class="recipe-lists">

          <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 ½ cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>½ cup almond butter (or peanut butter)</li>
            <li>¼ cup honey or maple syrup</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 large lemon</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of sea salt</li>
          </ul>

          <ol class="steps">
            <li>
              In a medium bowl, stir together the almond butter and honey until fully combined.
              If the mixture is too stiff to mix easily, microwave it for 10–15 seconds to soften.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt.
              Whisk or stir well until the mixture becomes smooth and glossy.
              The lemon juice may slightly loosen the mixture — that’s perfect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour in the rolled oats and mix using a spatula or your hands.
              Keep folding until every oat is coated and the dough begins to firm up.
              If the mixture feels too wet, add 1–2 tablespoons of oats.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.
              This allows the oats to absorb moisture, thicken, and bind naturally —
              making it easier to shape the cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scoop out small portions using a spoon or cookie scoop.
              Roll into balls or gently flatten with your palm to form cookie shapes.
              Place them on a parchment-lined tray.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chill the cookies in the refrigerator for 20–30 minutes.
              This firms them up and heightens the lemon flavor.
              They will become soft-chewy and hold their shape perfectly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Store the cookies in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week,
              or freeze for up to 2 months.
              The flavor becomes stronger and brighter after a day!
            </li>
          </ol>

            <p>
              For the brightest lemon flavor, always use fresh lemon zest — it releases aromatic oils that
              bottled juice can’t replace. If your mixture feels too sticky, chill it briefly before shaping.
              For a firmer bite, add an extra tablespoon of oats.
