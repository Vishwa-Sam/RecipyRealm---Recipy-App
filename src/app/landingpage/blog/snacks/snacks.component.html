    <h2>🇮🇹 Italian Arancini – Golden Rice Balls</h2>
    <div class="content-block">
      <p>
        Crispy on the outside and creamy within, Arancini are deep-fried risotto balls that originated in Sicily.
        Traditionally stuffed with a filling of mozzarella, peas, and ragù (meat sauce), these golden spheres are
        both comforting and indulgent. Each bite bursts with a creamy center wrapped in a crunchy breadcrumb coating —
        making them perfect for parties, picnics, or cozy evenings.

      <p>
        The name “Arancini” literally means “little oranges,” inspired by their golden color after frying.
        They’re best enjoyed warm, served with marinara or arrabbiata sauce for an authentic Italian touch.
        Once you make them, you’ll realize they’re more than just snacks — they’re a handheld taste of Italian
        tradition.

        <h3>🍚 Arancini Recipe</h3>

          <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 cups cooked risotto</li>
            <li>½ cup mozzarella cubes</li>
            <li>½ cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 eggs (beaten)</li>
            <li>½ cup flour</li>
            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
          </ul>

          <ol class="steps">
            <li>
              Take a small handful of cooked and cooled risotto. Flatten it in your palm and place
              a small cube of mozzarella (or your preferred filling) in the center.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gently wrap the risotto around the filling, shaping it into a tight ball.
              If the mixture sticks, wet your hands slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Roll each ball first in flour, then dip it in beaten eggs, and finally coat it with breadcrumbs.
              Press lightly so the coating sticks firmly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat oil in a deep pan to 170–180°C (340–355°F). Fry the arancini in small batches until
              they turn golden and crisp on all sides.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with warm marinara or arrabbiata sauce.

      <p>
        Daifuku Mochi is a soft, chewy dessert made from glutinous rice flour (mochiko) filled with a sweet paste —
        most commonly smooth red bean (anko). The delicate rice dough is steamed, pounded, and shaped by hand,
        resulting in a texture that’s tender yet elastic. It’s a bite-sized treat that captures Japan’s love for
        simplicity and balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern variations include strawberry-filled “Ichigo Daifuku,” matcha cream, or even ice cream centers.
        Mochi represents harmony — the perfect combination of chewiness, sweetness, and minimalism.
        Pair it with a cup of green tea, and you’ve got one of Japan’s most elegant snack experiences.

    <h2>🌶️ Mexican Elote – Grilled Street Corn</h2>
    <div class="content-block">
      <p>
        Elote is one of Mexico’s most iconic street foods — whole corn on the cob grilled over open flames until smoky
        and tender.
        It’s then slathered with creamy mayonnaise, sprinkled generously with cotija cheese, lime juice, and chili
        powder.
        The combination of charred sweetness, salt, and tangy spice is pure comfort food magic.

        This snack captures the essence of Mexican street culture — lively, colorful, and full of flavor.
        You can also make “Esquites,” the off-the-cob version served in a cup with all the same toppings.
        Whether served at a fair, beach, or barbecue, Elote turns ordinary corn into a celebration.

              Preheat a grill or stovetop griddle. Place the corn directly on the heat and grill,

            <li>
              While the corn is hot, brush each cob generously with mayonnaise or Mexican crema.

              Season with chili powder, smoked paprika, or Tajín for a spicy kick.

        Samosas are India’s signature savory snack — golden, triangular pastries filled with spiced potatoes,
        peas, and fragrant herbs. The outer crust is crisp and flaky, while the filling is rich, warm, and comforting.
        Each bite offers a perfect balance of textures and flavors, often complemented by tangy tamarind or mint
        chutney.

        Though most popular in India, samosas have traveled far and wide — from Middle Eastern sambusas to African

    <h2>🥐 French Madeleines – Soft Shell-Shaped Cakes</h2>
    <div class="content-block">
      <p>
        Light, buttery, and delicately sweet, Madeleines are small shell-shaped cakes that have become a symbol of
        French teatime.
        They’re made with simple ingredients — flour, eggs, sugar, and butter — but their charm lies in the tender crumb
        and lemon-scented aroma.
        A gentle dip in tea or coffee releases their delicate flavor and instantly transports you to a Parisian café.

        Madeleines were first popularized in the 18th century and have since become a staple in French patisseries.
        Modern takes include variations with chocolate, orange zest, or even lavender.
        These cakes prove that sometimes the simplest recipes can leave the most lasting impressions.
